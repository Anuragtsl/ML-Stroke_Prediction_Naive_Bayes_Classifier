# ML-Stroke_Prediction_Naive_Bayes_Classifier

I have created Machine Learning Model With Naive Bayes Classifier for Stroke Predictions.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Numpy](), [Pandas](), [Matplotlib](), [Seaborn](), [Imblearn](), [Sklearn]() and much more for Analysis, Vizualization and Model Development.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook]() for coding!

**Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)!**

# Closure

**In this project, we saw some of the factors that might result in strokes. Where Age was highly correlated followed by hypertension, heart disease, avg glucose level, and ever married.**

**There are outliers in some variable, reason behind why I kept it as it is because these things are either depends on other factors and there are possibilities of having such kind of records. For example, BMI can be high and still no stroke as a person is young or he/she does not have any heart disease.**
